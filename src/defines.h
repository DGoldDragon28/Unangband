/*
 * Do not edit this file unless you know *exactly* what you are doing.
 *
 * Some of the values in this file were chosen to preserve game balance,

 * definition of arrays in various places, mathematical properties, fast
 * computation, storage limits, or the format of external text files.
 *
 * Changing some of these values will induce crashes or memory errors or
 * savefile mis-reads.  Most of the comments in this file are meant as
 * reminders, not complete descriptions, and even a complete knowledge
 * of the source may not be sufficient to fully understand the effects
 * of changing certain definitions.
 *
 * Lastly, note that the code does not always use the symbolic constants
 * below, and sometimes uses various hard-coded values that may not even
 * be defined in this file, but which may be related to definitions here.
 * This is of course bad programming practice, but nobody is perfect...
 *
 * For example, there are MANY things that depend on the screen being
 * 80x24, with the top line used for messages, the bottom line being
 * used for status, and exactly 22 lines used to show the dungeon.
 * Just because your screen can hold 46 lines does not mean that the
 * game will work if you try to use 44 lines to show the dungeon.
 *
 * You have been warned.
