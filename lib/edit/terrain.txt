# File: terrain.txt

# This file is used to initialize the "lib/raw/terrain.raw" file, which is
# used to initialize the "terrain feature" information for the Angband game.

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.
# After modifying this file, delete the "lib/raw/terrain.raw" file.

# Note that terrain feature zero contains the "darkness" picture.

# Note that terrain feature one should contain the "unsafe" picture for
# unknown grids that may be trapped (With the view_unsafe_grid option
# on) but currently doesn't.

# === Understanding f_info.txt ===

# N : serial number : terrain name
# G : symbol : color
# M : feature to mimic
# W : level : rarity : priority : edge with feature
# K : change on this action : change to feature
# T : trap effect : damage
# S : trap spell
# F : flags

# 'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new item.

# 'G' is for graphics - symbol and color. There are 16 colors, as
# follows:

# D - Black        w - White          s - Gray          o - Orange
# r - Red          g - Green          b - Blue          u - Brown
# d - Dark Gray    W - Light Gray     v - Violet        y - Yellow
# R - Light Red    G - Light Green    B - Light Blue    U - Light Brown

# 'W' is for where the feature appears, its rarity, the priority number used
# when viewing the condensed map, and the index of a feature that surrounds
# this feature when it is generated on a level.

# 'K' is for state changes, where the feature changes when it has action
# applied to it. This works with various flags to handle state changes to
# an object. Note that we can apply state under some circumstances even when
# a feature does not support that flag. So it is important to have a DEFAULT
# type in many instances. Features support up to 4 state changes, plus a DEFAULT
# change.

# 'M' is the index of a feature to mimic.

# 'T' is for trap effects. These may be any effect and damage from attack that
# a monster may use, but a feature only has one possible trap effect per feature.

# 'S' is for trap spells, which are selected from monster spells. Each feature
# may only have one spell.

# 'F' is for flags. These are fairly self-explanatory, but clarified below. As many F:
# lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags and flags
# are separated by the '|' symbol.

# 'D' is for description. As many D: lines may be used as are needed
# to describe the feature. Note that lines may need spaces at their
# ends to prevent words from running together in the monster memory.

# ==== Feature flags ====

# Features now have flags, which are broken up into 2 sets of 32 flags, plus 2
# dummy flags (LOS and POWER_X). Feature flags simplify handling of transition
# of one feature to another (OPEN, CLOSE, HURT_FIRE etc.) and allow the cmd2.c
# code to be written cleaner and more flexibly.

# Note that LOS is implied implicitly by the 5th bit of the feature number. We do
# this for backwards compatibility with current save files.

# It is going to be replaced by using the CAVE_WALL bit set in the cave_info.
# This will allow us to have 512 features, which we would really like. We could
# possibly expand this to 1024 features with replacing CAVE_ICKY with a feature
# flag.

# ==== Additional features ====

# Additional features include the following:

# 1 replacement feature to handle case of unknown jammed door.

# 2 new features to correctly handle case of rubble with hidden items, and
# rubble with known items.

# 39 new traps, including 4 new types (magic symbol, stone visage, ancient hex
# and tripwire) and expanded previous types (deep pits, summoning
# runes of various flavours).

# 13 trapped doors, including unknown trapped doors. We replace a trapped door
# with the trap type whenever it is triggered to save having a door trap for
# each floor trap. They are treated as locked doors otherwise.

# 1 new streamer (SANDSTONE) which never has hidden or known treasure.

# The remaining new features are treated as terrain features.

# ==== Feature generation ====

# Terrain features are generated as lakes or rivers, or as a possible
# replacement for a lake or river or when two different terrain types
# overwrite each other. Zero, one or more terrain features are generated per
# level. Terrain features are generated before placement of rooms or
# corridors.

# A terrain feature with a LAKE flag generates a lake when selected. A
# terrain feature with a RIVER flag generates a RIVER when selected. A
# terrain feature with both flags generates both types when selected.

# A river grid is surrounded by grids containing the feature's edge terrain.
# A river grid is always placed adjacent to a previous river grid. A river
# tends to travel in one direction in the dungeon and stops when it reaches
# the edge of the dungeon.

# A lake grid is surrounded by lake grids, which are edged by grids containing
# the feature's edge terrain. Lake grids are scattered through the dungeon,
# adjacent to each other, until the maximum number of lake grids are placed
# on non-lake grids. Lake grids may be randomly replaced by the edge terrain,
# which means that a lake grid is not guaranteed to be reachable. XXX XXX XXX

# Rivers and regular lakes are guaranteed to be intersected by at least one
# corridor, and prevent rooms being placed in the same 11x11 location. Big
# lakes, which occur more frequently lower in the dungeon, may be have rooms
# placed over them, and may have parts of the lake cut off by room placement
# so that they become unreachable. XXX XXX XXX

# Corridors create paths through terrain that has PATH flags and tunnel through terrain
# that has TUNNEL flags. This is done to guarantee that there is always a
# safe path from room to room, even if that 'safe' path requires walking
# through shallow acid. Terrain that is neither COVERED or tunnelled through
# must otherwise be crossable. XXX

# Deep terrain comes in two varieties, hidden deep terrain and known deep
# terrain. Known deep terrain is crossed by stone or ice bridges. Hidden
# deep terrain is crossed by paths of shallow terrain. Hidden deep terrain
# should always be detectable as a secret, so that the paths of shallow
# terrain may be located and navigated across. Great care should be made to
# never mix known deep and either shallow or hidden deep terrain so that
# we don't get 'breaks' in bridges.

# The base of falls are an exception. They are known deep terrain, that we
# never bridge. They should be uncommon, even when generated, because the
# majority of the terrain they appear in will be hidden deep terrain. They
# are surrounded by shallow terrain, so can always be navigated around.

# Some terrain types overwrite other terrain types with intermediate terrain
# types. This is determined in generate.c but should be replaced in the 
# future with a smart algorithm because there are O(n^2) possible
# combinations of terrain to have to deal with. This has for the most part
# been done, but not tested thoroughly, as we had to support different 'types'
# of water.

# Some terrain types replace themselves with different terrain when placed.
# This is determined in generate.c, and is to break up the monotony of one
# type of terrain.

# Trails may be made through terrain of various sort by the player and
# monsters crossing that terrain. This may provide indirect evidence of
# invisible monsters, and movement of out of line of sight monsters. XXX

# Covered and deep terrain of various types can hide monsters. They can
# pop-up or bash up from this terrain to cast spells and attack the player,
# and remain visible until they move again.

# We do not have any terrain that only causes nuisance damage, because this
# would allow the player to take unnecessary advantage of such terrain,
# either by harassing monsters from it, or weakening or killing
# monsters through exploiting the movement algorithms. As it is, any terrain
# a monster moves over should will not damage it at all, except for traps.

# We don't make ice floors and geothermal floors damage the player. However,
# we do need to distinguish when there exists a terrain that a monster may be
# hidden under, and retain these terrain types for this possibility.

# We need to have a level 1, rarity 1 cave type or we generate lava at low
# levels. We use granite for this.

# We generate magma, quartz and sandstone cave types without treasure to add
# some variety to dungeon streamers.

# Limestone is actually a cave type with floor space in it, and rarely
# occuring limestone formations, which can be tunnelled easily.

# Ice is transparent walls of various types. However, we allow the player to
# block line of sight through ice to save them from distant monsters casting
# LOS spells at them. This is possible by huge ball spells of various sorts,
# which cause enough damage to crack the ice.

# Chasms use the CHASM flag to considerably neaten themselves up.

# Note that even shallow lava is dangerous (and COVERED) and there is no
# shallow BOILING MUD/WATER.

# Note that we use WATER | LAVA | ICE | ACID | OIL to mark a level as such,
# and prevent features marked with other types, being generated on the same
# level. Note that various WATER types are actually marked as LAVA or ICE
# types instead, to force generation of boiling or icy water only on the
# particular levels.

# Note that we use WATER | LAVA | ICE | ACID | CHASM to favour generation of
# creatures suitable for that level, ahead of those that are not. This is a
# hack. XXX XXX

# Note that we have to prevent monsters flowing whenever there is terrain that
# they cannot flow over within the flow space. We also allow more monsters to
# move on terrain than are technically immune to the damage. We allow IM_FIRE
# & CAN_SWIM monsters on BWATER blows, IM_FIRE and CAN_DIG monsters on BMUD
# blows. There is no ICE damage that can be caused by floor terrain
# currently. We allow BRTH_FIRE monsters on LAVA. Otherwise we would have to
# check monsters for elemental type and prefix, which adds expense to the
# movement computation.

# In order to allow this, we must make sure we never damage a monster that
# can flow through a particular terrain type. We make HIT_TRAPs an exception,
# because most monsters can DISARM or destroy the traps. 

# If a terrain has BLOWS and is not HIT_TRAP then the terrain does damage
# when moved onto and every (dungeon) turn (Actually 10 turns).

# Note that the graphics have expanded but consistant meaning, so that
# "%" is a mineral vein/cracks, ":" is a known deep feature (with rubble 
# being 'deep' open floor), ">" is a chasm/fall/stairs and "<" is stairs/base
# of falls. "#" is consistently a wall feature, passable by CAN_SWIM/CAN_DIG
# /CAN_PASS only (unlike other varients). ";" is either glyph or vent or
# dangerous shallow floor, ''' is an open door or cloud, and '.' is a floor
# or bridge.

# Note that the colours of various features are regularised, although in many
# instances different from creatures. It should provide pretty dungeon
# pictures though.

# 'w' is used for granite/quartz, 'W' is used for limestone/steam, 'y' for
# sand/sand stone, 'D' for oil/coal, 'b' for water, 'B' for ice,  'g' for
# acid, 'G' for gas, 'R' for lava, 'o' for boiling mud/burning oil, 'v' for
# boiling water/geothermal, 's' for broken/missing floor/magma.

# Note that 'R' should be carefully used as it is very hard to distinguish from
# 'r' (lava) particularly for '.', ';' and ':' graphics. Note however that lava
# GLOWs so should be much more easily recognisable.

# Note we also use 'o' to mark trails of various sorts through sand/mud/
# earth. This doesn't confuse the borg because of a couple of minor graphical
# switches (burning oil always 'looks' deep).

# All the traps/trapped doors of a particular appearance have the same colour.
# We don't want to have traps in 'U' because trapped doors will be
# indistinguishable from the plain type.

# We don't mimic traps so that particular users can mark traps with a
# particular style, to indicate 'deadly' traps if required.
